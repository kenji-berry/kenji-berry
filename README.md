# - About Me
I’m **Kenji Berry**, a bilingual (English/Japanese) full‑stack developer based between **London** and **Kobe, Japan**, with a **First‑Class Honours BSc in Computer Science** from Queen Mary University of London.  

I specialise in **front‑end development** using **JavaScript, Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, and Supabase**, and I’m currently advancing my **TypeScript** expertise. I also have experience with **Python, C#, SQL/NoSQL databases, and GitHub CI/CD**.  

My key projects include **Skinergy**, a League of Legends skin collection and matcher, and **CodeConnect**, a platform connecting open‑source projects with contributors. Both highlight my focus on building scalable, user‑friendly applications.  

I thrive in collaborative teams, delivering clean, maintainable code under deadlines. Outside of work, I enjoy **calisthenics** and **cooking**, which keep me balanced and creative. I’m open to opportunities in **London, Japan, or remote**.
